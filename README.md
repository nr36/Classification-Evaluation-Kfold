# CS634-FinalProject
Classification and evaluating Naive Bayes, Random forest and LSTM using 10fold cross validation
To check how the overall code runs, 
please run rani_nishi_finaltermproj.py or rani_nishi_finaltermproj.ipynb
To check just the overall Output:
Run Output.py (It takes codeAsFunction.py as a function and prints the output table)
Note: It is bit slow to print the output because of LSTM model. So some waiting time is expected.
The final result is stored in 'FinalResult.xlsx'
